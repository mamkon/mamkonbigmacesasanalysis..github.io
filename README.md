Objective:
This project analyzes The Big Mac Index, a global economic indicator developed by The Economist, to measure purchasing power parity (PPP) and currency valuation across countries.
By using McDonald's Big Mac prices as a benchmark, the analysis explores currency valuation, economic disparities, and the relationship between GDP per capita and Big Mac prices.
The goal is to assess currency undervaluation or overvaluation using the Raw and Adjusted Indices.
